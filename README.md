# TOOL1_FINAL_PROJECT

**This involves a very, very poor model**. In fact, I wouldn't really say this project features any model at all. This was mostly to practice cleaning some very messy data in Pandas, along with some exploratory data analysis.
This was a project done for my Data Science Tools 1 course for the Data Science program @ Unversity of Denver. This project examines homelessness in Los Angeles, drawing comparisons to statistics drawn from nationwide Census data.
